***Plans/TODOs***
General TODOs-----------------------------
-Input validation (Simple regex should cover most or all cases)
    -Handle forms better (don't allow submit with validation errors, displaying input/validation errors + required fields, etc.)
-Fix dialog maxWidths

-Complete mobile-friendly interface revamp
-Make 'Home Management' and 'Vehicle Management' their own pages
    -House Management: appliances (name, manufacturer, model year, year bought?, upload manual), projects section?, notes section for misc. stuff like paint colors
-Make/implement 'Grocery List' page
-Add 'Export/Backup data' to family page
    *Link budgets to families (implement family being required to make budget - as opposed to current profile-only req)
    *Data included/exported: all finance stuff w/ only key data points, family board text dump, home/vehicle management data
-Better savings chart (labels shouldn't overlap and should always be clearly visible - see Google charts)
-Consider redoing navbar/(main-)menu?



Finance TODOs-----------------------------
-Ability to edit existing transactions (https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/editing/)


Maintenance TODOs------------------------
-None


Profile TODOs------------------------------
-Add pets, remove members
-Edit family data


Ideas-----------------------
-Refactor to TypeScript if insane
-Add secondary editors in addition to head of household?

-Light/dark mode? *VERY low priority*
